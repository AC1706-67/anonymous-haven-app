## 🙏 Final Word

I started this journey **tech illiterate** — learning one keystroke at a time.  
Now, by the grace of God and the power of AI, I’m building tools that help others **heal, learn, and lead**.

> “I believe in second chances, third tries, and infinite grace.  
> If you do too — welcome to the movement.”

**Built with faith, powered by innovation, and guided by love for people in recovery.** 💚
